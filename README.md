Replicating the features of meteor without meteor

## Status: Development

***

This is simply an example app showing some of the killer features of meteor without using meteor.

 - JavaScript everywhere
 - Live data
 - Reactive UI
 - Automatic code restart pushed to client

Other advantages that meteor doesn't have

 - Actually works without JS
 - Is not a leaky abstraction
 - code restart is far more elegant
 - uses client-side Database storage
